        "For this doctrine to apply, three conditions must typically be met:\n",
        "\n",
        "The accident wouldn‚Äôt normally happen without negligence:\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: A pedestrian is struck by a falling air conditioning unit while walking down the street. This is not something that usually happens unless someone was careless.\n",

        "Example: If a patient undergoes surgery and a sponge is left inside their body, the surgical team had exclusive control over the operating room environment.\n",

        "The plaintiff did not contribute to the accident:\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: If a person is sitting in a parked car and a tree limb falls on them, they clearly did nothing to cause the accident.\n",
        "\n",
        "üí° Example in Practice:\n",
        "Imagine you‚Äôre dining at a restaurant, and a ceiling fan suddenly detaches and falls, injuring you.\n",
        "\n",
        "Under res ipsa loquitur, you wouldn‚Äôt need to prove exactly how the restaurant was negligent (e.g., poor maintenance or faulty installation).\n",
        "\n",
        "The mere fact that the fan fell is enough to infer negligence, because ceiling fans don‚Äôt typically fall without someone being careless.\n",
        "\n",
        "üî• Impact of Res Ipsa Loquitur:\n",
        "Burden of Proof Shifts: The burden shifts to the defendant, who must prove they were not negligent.\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "üí° Key Difference:\n",
        "In res ipsa loquitur cases, the event itself clearly wouldn‚Äôt happen without negligence (e.g., a surgical instrument left inside a patient).\n",
